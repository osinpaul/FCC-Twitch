Welcome to my Twitch.TV JSON API App!

This app get JSON from Twith.TV API and displays filtered view. 

My App follow the next user stories:

User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

This APP works with API Key, i got it on FCC Forum (http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541)

You can try it yourself on my demo page: https://osinpaul.ru/projects/twitchView

Good luck!
